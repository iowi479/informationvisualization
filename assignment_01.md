## Task 1 Characterizations of Visualization Disciplines [Points: 5]

### (a) (2 points) Define Information Visualization and Scientific Visualization in your own words.
Information Visualization: Shows non-spatial data in a specific way so it is easier to identify patterns or relationships.
It shows abstract data and statistics.
E.g. Finantial Data, social network diagrams

Scientific Visualization: Shows spatial data in a way so you can understand or identify aspects hidden in the data.
It shows physical data of a simulation or experiment to visualize phenomena.
E.g. Modelling specific objects, Simulations

### (b) (2 points) Assign each of the images (a to d) in Figure 1 to Information Visualization or Scientific Visualization, whichever fits best.
- (a) top left: Scientific Visualization (spatial data, windtunnel)
- (b) top right: Information Visualization (non-spatial data, bargraph)
- (c) bottom left: Information Visualization (non-spatial data, shows amounts)
- (d) bottom right: Scientific Visualization (spatial data, 3d-model of a skull)

### (c) (1 points) Explain why the border between the two fields can be fuzzy.
Differentiating between spatial and non-spatial data is hard.
You could visualize financial data(information visualization) in a timely manner.
This could be seen as scientific(spatial data).

Also the techniques to show the data are similare among both fields.
Sometimes even the goal overlaps, to visualize the data in an easier manner to learn something from it.

Even in the scientific world both techniques are mixed for even better visualizations.

## Task 2 Motivation of Information Visualization [Points: 2]
You heard of the Four Vs of Big Data in the lecture. Briefly describe how information visualization
could help tackle the respective challenges for each of the four terms.

- Volume - All data could potentially be relevant
    There often is A LOT of data. Therefore it is hard to comprehend all of it.
    With the right visualizations it is easier to focus on patterns and find the relevant data in the haystack.

- Velocity - Data might be produced faster than it is processed
    With data beeing generated really fast, it is important to grasp a whole picture as fast as possible.
    A quick visualization can help to really quickly glams over the data and see id there are interessting aspects to further dig into.

- Veracity - Data is associated with uncertainties
    Not all data is of 100% quality and reliable.
    With the right visualization it is possible to quickly identify falsy data if the result doesnt seem to "look right".
    Or it is possible to identify parts of the data that "look odd" and notice poor quality quickly.

- Variety - Different sources/forms of data have to be connected
    Data from different sources or forms can be hard to compare.
    You can visualize different data in aspects they relate and gain insights into the relations quickly.(visualization in the same diagram with different colors)


## Task 3 Historical Visualization in Epidemiology [Points: 4]
Using data analytics and visualization, John Snow and Florence Nightingale saved many lives during
epidemics and wars. Figure 2 shows the Rose Diagram or Polar Area Diagram produced by
Florence Nightingale in 1855.
Describe the different data attributes that Florence Nightingale included in the Rose Diagram and
how they are mapped visually.

- total deaths per month: comparing the size of different wedges shows the relation in how many deaths there where.(Big wedge = many deaths)
- deaths over time: Showing the months next to each others shows a timely relation in how the deathcount changed over time.
- wedge-colors: The different colors encode the cause of the displayed deaths. (E.g. red-wedges: deaths from wounds)
